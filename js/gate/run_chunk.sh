# run_chunk.sh NAME IDS [WAIT] - one gate run of the JavaScript engine on the models listed in IDS, as the brief
# requires: through runswmm_saves.sh (SAVE files backed up and restored), inside flock on the shared corpus lock
# (waiting at most WAIT seconds, default 4800, for another agent's run to finish), -j 1, a 1800 s timeout per
# model, --prune, the output folder in /dev/shm (lesson 22) and the wrapper's backups there too.
# Writes gate/NAME_run.txt and js/gate/NAME_start.txt (start and end times). Written by Claude (Anthropic).
